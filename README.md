This is a single-page web app utilizing React. In this project I utilize the following: 
//1. functional components to map out each individual book component and their detail components to the virtual DOM
//2. useState to enable conditional rendering, as well as pass a State as a prop that can be mapped on components down the hierarchy
//3.  useEffect to make asynchonous calls to the Open Library API to display data on a list of books by one of my favorite authors, Brandon Sanderson.
